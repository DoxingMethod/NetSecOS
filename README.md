Unfortunitly, I can't upload the files here, as Github does not allow the file types etc.

# Info

This project took me roughly about two months to create and code. It's been hard as I've not done anything like this before. I had some help with it as well. <3

# Future Projects / Ideas

I've got some other projects that I'll be working on with some college friends. These will include:

Custom programming language, similar to Python, but easier to use.
Multi IDE program accessible via Browser and Phone.

# Just a note.
Sorry for not uploading much, I've been busy with college etc.
